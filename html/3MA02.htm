Grant us peace, that the cast down and broken hearted may praise you with their mouth.  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>At that time God, who sees all things, who is beyond all Holy among the holy, heard that prayer, so suitable; and scourged the man greatly uplifted with scorn and insolence.  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Shaking him to and fro as a reed is shaken with the wind, he cast him upon the pavement, powerless, with limbs paralyzed; by a righteous judgment deprived of the faculty of speech.  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>His friends and bodyguards, beholding the swift recompense which had suddenly overtaken him, struck with exceeding terror, and fearing that he would die, speedily removed him.  <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>When in course of time he had come to himself, this severe check caused no repentance within him, but he departed with bitter threatenings.  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>He proceeded to Egypt, grew worse in wickedness through his before mentioned companions in wine, who were lost to all goodness;  <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>and not satisfied with countless acts of impiety, his audacity so increased that he raised evil reports there, and many of his friends, watching his purpose attentively, joined in furthering his will.  <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>His purpose was to indict a public stigma upon our race; wherefore he erected a pillar at the tower-porch, and caused the following inscription to be engraved upon it:  <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>That entrance to their own temple was to be refused to all those who would not sacrifice; that all the Jews were to be registered among the common people; that those who resisted were to be forcibly seized and put to death;  <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>that those who were thus registered, were to be marked on their persons by the ivy-leaf symbol of Dionysus, and to be set apart with these limited rights.  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>To do away with the appearance of hating them all, he had it written underneath, that if any of them should elect to enter the community of those initiated in the rites, these should have equal rights with the Alexandrians.  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Some of those who were over the city, therefore, abhorring any approach to the city of piety, unhesitatingly gave in to the king, and expected to derive some great honor from a future connection with him.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>A nobler spirit, however, prompted the majority to cling to their religious observances, and by paying money that they might live unmolested, these sought to escape the registration:  <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>cheerfully looking forward to future aid, they abhorred their own apostates, considering them to be national foes, and debarring them from the common usages of social intercourse. </div><ul class='tnav'>
