and he said to the tyrant,  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Thinkest you not, most cruel of all tyrants, that you are now tortured more than I, finding your overweening conception of tyranny conquered by our perseverance in behalf of our religion?  <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>For I lighten my suffering by the pleasures which are connected with virtue.  <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>But you are tortured with threatenings for impiety; and you shall not escape, most corrupt tyrant, the vengeance of Divine wrath. </div><ul class='tnav'>
